# Statistics theory: a deeper dive
Welcome to the theory activity!

The purpose of the following theory sections is twofold:
- First, to reinforce our understanding of many of the concepts we've covered so far, but from a theoretical perspective, and
- Second, to extend our grasp of the subject by introducing some new valuable concepts.

> _This section will not require you to do any coding; it's purely conceptual._


## Sections
This activity is divided into 3 _read-only_ sections:

1. **Part 1**: [Sampling, the Central Limit Theorem and Confidence intervals](theory1.md)

2. **Part 2**: [Hypothesis testing](theory2.md)

3. **Part 3**: [Sample size, effect size, and statistical power](theory3.md)



## Learning objectives
* Define the sampling distribution and explain its relation to sample size.
* Explain the Central Limit Theorem and appreciate its importance.
* Explain confidence intervals, why we use them, and how they can be generated.
* Reinforce the methodology for hypothesis testing, from the formulation of a Null and Alternate hypothesis to generating and interpreting p-values.
* Explain the difference between parametric and non-parametric tests.
* Explain the differences between Student's T, Welch's, and Mann-Whitney U's statistical tests, and when each is appropriate to use.
* Understand ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA) as a technique for testing multiple groups.
* Explain the relevance of, and difference between Type I and Type II errors.
* Explain and interpret the relationship between sample size, effect size, and statistical power.
