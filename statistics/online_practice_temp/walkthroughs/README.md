# Walkthroughs
This section is intended to walk you through the coding activity challenges step-by-step. It compliments the completed notebook for this activity, which you can find [here]().

The walkthroughs are divided into six sections, each corresponding to stage in the coding activity:

1. [Walkthrough: Brief](0_brief.md) _corresponds to_ the [Outline](./online_practice/0_brief.md) section of the coding activity.

2. [Walkthrough: Reading the data](1_reading.md) _corresponds to_ the ["Understanding your data"](./online_practice/1_reading.md) section of the coding activity.

3. [Walkthrough: Cleaning & Transformation](2_cleaning.md) _corresponds to_ the [Data cleaning and transformation](./online_practice/2_cleaning.md) section of the coding activity.

4. [Walkthrough: EDA](3_eda.md) _corresponds to_ the [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](./online_practice/3_eda.md) section of the coding activity.

5. [Walkthrough: Hypothesis Testing](4_htesting.md) _corresponds to_ the [Hypothesis Testing](./online_practice/4_htesting.md) section of the coding activity.

6. [Walkthrough: Statistical Power](5_power.md) _corresponds to_ the [Sample size, effect and statistical power](./online_practice/5_power.md) section of the coding activity.
