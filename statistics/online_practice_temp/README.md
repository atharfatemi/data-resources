# Introduction to statistics: Practice
You can think of this part of the module as two separate activities:

#### 1. Theory:<br>
  - This is a deeper dive into the underlying theory of various concepts discussed so far, and new key concepts we haven't looked at yet.
  - No code is involved.


#### 2. Code<br>
  - In this activity you will apply various descriptive and inferential statistics concepts in code to solve a real-world problem: conducting an A/B test.
  - Code is involved.

### Where do I start, where do I end?
The two sections, theory and code, are distinct; there is no direct link between the two. This means how you complete this practice is really up to you, and how you prefer to learn. You can:

**Strategy 1**: *Start with the code, then move on to the theory.*
- If you are someone who enjoys getting hands-on first, and
- You are comfortable with hypothesis testing methodology

**Strategy 2**: *Start with the theory, then move on the code.*<br>
- If you are someone who likes to solidify their understanding of the underlying theory before applying any of it and/or
- You enjoy a deeper dive into the abstract every now and then.

**Strategy 3**: *Jump around between both.*<br>
- If you like to dip into the abstract to get introduced to the concept only to solidify your grasp on the subject right after that with application and/or
- If you like to start with the code and test the limits of what you know, only to refer to the theory to expand on your knowledge.


> We recommend Strategy 3, but again, it's completely up to you!

## Learning Objectives
* Build on theoretical concepts related to sampling, with new concepts such as sampling distributions, the Central Limit Theorem and confidence intervals.
* Reinforce the methodology of hypothesis testing, and related theoretical concepts such as p-values, and significance/confidence levels.
* Review the assumptions and differences between the Student’s T-Test, and Welch’s T-Test as two parametric tests.
* Review the Mann-Whitney U, and permutation tests as two non-parametric tests.
* Introduce ANalysis Of Variance (ANOVA) as a technique for testing multiple groups.
* Introduce the two main types of error we can encounter when testing, Type I and Type II errors.
* Explain and interpret the relationship between sample size, effect size, and statistical power.
* Execute an A/B test in code,  that involves exploratory data analysis, asking a research question, formulating null and alternative hypotheses, implementing the appropriate statistical test(s), and interpreting the results.

**By the end of this activity, learners will be able to:**<br>
* Explain sampling distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and confidence intervals.
* Understand the difference between the two parametric tests, Student’s T-Test and Welch’s T-Test.
* Explain one-way ANOVA, as an alternative test, for more than two samples
* Explain the difference between Type I and Type II errors, and how they may relate to sample size.
* Describe the dynamic between sample size, effect size, and statistical power.
* Perform, analyse and interpret a two-tailed statistical test in code, to solve an A/B testing problem.
